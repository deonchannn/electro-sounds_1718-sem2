#  Electro Sound visuals

**Description of Proposed Project**

The idea of my project is to do a sound reactive visuals. This concept was inspired by artist such as Royji Ikeda, Alva noto and etc. The sketch will mainly react to the 3 frequency band(Low, Mid and High frequencies) and that in turn will trigger different effects to it. The sketch will consist of many small particles that will form a big particle which gives me the flexibility to do different effects. Another factor of the sketch that will be affected is the background colour. It will change colour according to the frequency band that the audio is feeding into the sketch. My sketch falls under the category of Interactive , Audio reactive, Live performance and frantic.

**Methodology**

Firstly, I will do a few sketches that can be used in my final sketch for submission. For example, doing an audio sketch where I can test the codes and understand how it works especially when I am dealing with a new terms such as getEnergy().  Once I am able to get that sketch to work, I will then move on the next sketch, which would be particles. I will then combine the audio sketch and the particle sketch and make them work together as one big sketch. I feel this is a better way for me to work, where I do step by step and slowly achieve short-term results. And doing this way is easier for me to rectify issues because I am able to identify the issues when it's a small focused part of the sketch rather than the whole final sketch together. I am also able to play around with numbers and understand how the codes work. As for the physical end, I will try with different pieces of music to see how drastic does the sketch changes. Another thing to focus on would be the colour scheme, which I feel, I will go with a black and white background but the particles will be showing random colours as the frequencies get higher. This will create some contrast between the particles and the background. And also it does not feel painful to the eyes of the audience.

This is one picture where I can reference in terms of the random colours that will change in the particles

One of the reaction I hope to achieve would be something like this, where it would form a spiral shape as it hits a certain frequency band in the music.


This is a good example of how I want the particles to look like its expanding from each other.

**Soundtrack Details**

My soundtrack that I will be doing would either be a piece that will consist of beats or a noise piece. Because I feel that doing this kinds of piece would bring out the full potential of my sketch in terms of frequencies. Like a glitch beat piece, I can pull out the full range of frequencies and I have also tested my audio sketch with music pieces done by Ryoji Ikeda and it works very well with it. And if I did a noise piece, I am able to put crazy moments that can do crazy effects in the visuals which ultimately is one my sections that I want to focus on.

Alva Noto + Opaite – Opoto File 2 -2001

This work is closely related to how the audio affects the size of the circle. But instead of just the size, mine will change in color.

Ryoji Ikeda – Data.Mircohelix

My music will be similar to this as a rhythm piece And I like how the sketch reacts to the music when the different frequency hits and when it hits, The sketches get a little more crazy as it goes.

Ryoji Ikeda & Alva Noto – id#09

I like how the two artist I reference did a collaboration and this visual has this nice effect where it comes in and out due to the piece. There are like maybe 2 – 3 elements that is happening either concurrently or when 1 obvious gesture is made.
