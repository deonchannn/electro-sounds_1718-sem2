#  Electro Sound visuals

**Description of Proposed Project**

The idea of my project is using soundtracks to affect my visuals.The sketch will react to the soundtracks which are separated to (Low, Mid and High frequencies) and that will trigger different variations that will affect the sketch one way or another. The sketch will consist of 3 different variations. The first variation will contain plane shapes that will respond to high frequencies which will cause the size of the radius to change and also change the colours. The second variation will respond to Mid frequencies which will cause the size of the circle shape to become smaller and the colours will change to yellow. And the last variation will respond to the Low frequencies which causes the radius of the circle shape to become the smallest while it cycles around the second variation.

**Reflection**

Doing this sketch has been challenging but fun at the same time. I learnt new techniques that I've applied to my final sketch. It includes using getEnergy function to extract out the different frequencies. Over time, as I kept doing my mini sketches leading up to the final one, my work flow started to be quicker as I became more familiar with the program.

I came across challenges such as my sketch not working the way I wanted it to and I can just dwell on it for days trying to fix it. I learnt that sometimes, the error could be very minor and overlooked easily. I also learnt to look at the sketches in different ways. For example, sometimes technique 1 works but the steps to achieve it can be tedious, where else, technique 2 requires steps that is easier to achieve and it works the same as technique 1.

Overall, the experience working with code again made me fall in love with it again as I have done it before during my diploma days. P5JS had more relevance to what I was interested in and when I achieved the outcome that I wanted, the inner nerd in me smiled.
This might be a start of something that I might start to work more on it and produce visuals that I want to show.
